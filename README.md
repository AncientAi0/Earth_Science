### Question 1

**Q:** **How do geologists use gravimeters to measure variations in the force of gravity?**

**A:** Geologists use gravimeters to measure variations in the force of gravity. A gravimeter is a sensitive instrument that contains a weight suspended on a spring. It responds to variations in gravity by measuring the force exerted on the weight [14a]. By using gravimeters, geologists can detect departures from the expected force of gravity, known as gravity anomalies [14a]. These anomalies can indicate the presence of mass excesses or deficiencies in the Earth's crust [14a]. Gravity surveys conducted using gravimeters have proven useful in exploring for minerals and hydrocarbons [14b].

### Question 2

>Although you may never have experienced a volcanic eruption, an earthquake, or a flood, you have certainly seen reports or TV specials on these topics or at least read about them. In contrast, most people have not given much thought to Earth’s interior, and as a result it is a difficult topic for beginning students. You might appreciate the stunning beauty of the aurora borealis (northern lights) and be completely unaware that Earth’s magnetic field is partly responsible for them. Given that Earth’s interior

**Q:** **Expalin this**

**A:** This statement is explaining that although people may have never personally experienced natural disasters like volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, or floods, they are likely familiar with them through reports or TV specials. On the other hand, most people haven't given much thought to the Earth's interior, making it a challenging topic for beginners to understand.

The statement further mentions the stunning beauty of the aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights. However, it suggests that many people may not realize that the Earth's magnetic field plays a significant role in the creation of this natural phenomenon.

The reason for this lack of understanding is explained by the fact that the Earth's interior is completely inaccessible to us. Unlike the surface of the Earth, which we can explore and study directly, we have limited tools and methods to analyze and study the Earth's internal structure and composition. As a result, the majority of people have little knowledge about these aspects or how scientists have determined them.

>Scientists now have a reasonably good idea of Earth’s overall density, composition, and internal structure ( Figure 11.1). During most of historic time, though, people perceived of Earth’s interior as an underground world of vast caverns, heat, and sulfur gases populated by demons or the souls of those waiting to be judged. Many cultures have myths to explain volcanoes and earthquakes as manifestations of the activities of deities that dwell far below the surface. The Romans believed that Vulcan, the god of fire, had underground workshops where his beating on anvils caused the ground to rumble and volcanoes to erupt. And in Mexico earthquakes were attributed to El Diablo (the devil) as he tried to rip open Earth’s crust.

>From our perspective these ancient myths may seem naïve, but some rather bizarre ideas about Earth’s interior persist even now (see “Earth’s Place in the Cosmos” on pp. 338–339). For instance, in 1869 Cyrus Reed Teed claimed that Earth is hollow and that humans live on the inside. And in 1913 Marshall B. Gardener held that Earth is a large, hollow sphere with a 1300km-thick outer shell surrounding a central Sun, and access can be gained through holes at the poles. Even today, books and articles promote the hollow Earth concept, and several websites are devoted to this thesis. According to some, Earth’s interior has been visited by groups of explorers in recent times, and the government is aware of the openings to Earth’s interior but keeps this information from us. Other books, articles, and websites hold that Earth is flat, at the center of the universe, or both.

**Q:** **Explain this**

**A:** Comprehending Earth's internal processes is important in order to fully understand phenomena that occur on the surface. Numerous surface features and events, such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, the movement of tectonic plates, and the formation of mountains, are directly influenced by the dynamic processes occurring within the Earth. By studying the interior of the Earth, scientists can gain insights into the factors that drive these surface phenomena.

For example, understanding the distribution of heat within the Earth's interior is crucial in explaining the occurrence of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. The slow release of heat from the Earth's interior plays a significant role in making the planet a dynamic and ever-changing system. By studying the internal heat processes, scientists can better predict and understand the occurrence of such phenomena.

Additionally, comprehending the composition and density of different layers within the Earth allows scientists to explain various geological processes and phenomena. For instance, the composition and density of the mantle and crust influence the behavior of tectonic plates and the formation of mountains.

Moreover, studying the internal structure of the Earth helps correct misconceptions and speculative theories. Throughout history, numerous myths and incorrect theories have emerged to explain phenomena related to the Earth's interior. By thoroughly understanding Earth's internal structure, scientists can debunk such myths and promote accurate information.

Overall, understanding Earth's internal processes provides a solid foundation for explaining and predicting surface phenomena, and it helps to dispel misunderstandings and speculative theories about the nature of our planet.

>lowed a labyrinth of passageways until they arrived 140 km below the surface. (In the 1959 movie of the same name, three men and one woman reached the center of the planet.) Professor Hardwigg and his companions encountered a vast cavern illuminated by some electrical phenomenon, and they saw herds of mastodons (extinct relatives of elephants) and a gigantic human shepherd, Mesozoic-aged reptiles, and huge turtles in what Verne call the “central sea.” Their adventure ended when they were carried back to the surface on a rising plume of water (lava in the movie).

**Q:** **Explain this**

**A:** The passage describes a fictional story called "Journey to the Center of the Earth" written by Jules Verne in 1864. In the novel, Professor Hardwigg, his nephew, and an Icelandic guide go on an adventure to explore the Earth's interior. They descend through a volcano in Iceland and navigate through a complex network of tunnels until they reach a depth of 140 kilometers below the surface.

Inside the Earth, they discover a vast cavern that is illuminated by some unknown source of electrical phenomenon. They encounter various extinct creatures such as mastodons, Mesozoic-aged reptiles, and huge turtles in what Verne refers to as the "central sea." Eventually, their journey comes to an end when they are carried back to the surface on a rising plume of water (lava in the movie).

It's important to note that Jules Verne's novel is a work of fiction and not based on scientific evidence. Verne did not make any claims about providing an accurate depiction of Earth's interior. The story serves as an imaginative adventure that takes readers on a thrilling journey to a fantastical world beneath the surface of the Earth.

### Question 5

>Scientists can make no direct observations of Earth’s interior, so how is it possible to determine Earth’s overall density and what it looks like inside? Its size is less problematic. Scientists can calculate the density from the gravitational attraction exerted by Earth or other objects, such as the Moon, and its size. Additionally, they study seismic waves, meteorites, and inclusions in igneous rocks, and then evaluate the results of laboratory experiments to figure out the internal structure. 
>
>
>Even when Jules Verne wrote his novel in 1864 scientists knew that Earth’s overall density is about 5.5 g/cm 3  and that pressure and temperature increase with depth. Little else was known, although humans had probed beneath the surface with mines and wells for centuries. Even the deepest mines extend down to only about 3 km, however, whereas the deepest drill hole, about 12 km, penetrates only 0.18% of the distance to the center of the planet ( Figure 11.2).

> Why is it unlikely that vast caverns exist far below y 
> Earth’s surface?
>
>
>No vast caverns exist far below Earth’s surface, even at the rather modest depth of 140 km as in Jules Verne’s story, where rock is so hot, yet solid, and under such tremendous pressure that it yields by flowage to any applied force. Accordingly, even if an open space somehow existed, rock flowage would quickly eliminate it. In fact, rocks encountered in very deep mines and drill holes behave very differently than they do at the surface. Remember from Chapter 6 that, because of pressure release, rock bursts and popping are constant problems in mines and that rocks that form under great pressure expand outward and fracture when exposed at the surface (see Figure 6.5). 
>
>
>Among the terrestrial planets, Earth, with a diameter of 12,760 km at the equator, is slightly larger than Venus and much larger than Mercury, Mars, and Earth’s Moon. Its equatorial diameter is slightly greater than its polar diameter, so it is an oblate spheroid rather than a true sphere. Scientists have known for more than 200 years that Earth is not homogeneous throughout. Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727) noted that Earth’s average density—that is, its mass per unit of volume—is 5.0 to 6.0 g/cm 3 , and in 1797 Henry Cavendish calculated a density value very close to the 5.52 g/cm 3  now accepted.

>
>
>To accurately determine Earth’s density, first its size had to be known. In the third century B.C.the Greek librarian Eratosthenes (c.276–c.195 B.C.) determined that Earth’s circumference is about 40,000 km—a figure only slightly different from the one accepted now (see “Earth’s Place in the Cosmos” on pp. 338–339). From this, one can calculate Earth’s diameter and radius, and then determine the volume of our nearly spherical planet. 

**Q:** **Explain this**

**A:** Scientists determine Earth's overall density by calculating the gravitational attraction exerted by Earth on other objects, such as the Moon, and by studying seismic waves, meteorites, and inclusions in rocks. By evaluating the results of laboratory experiments and analyzing these data, scientists can infer the internal structure and density of the Earth.

The determination of Earth's size is less problematic because its diameter and circumference can be measured directly. The Greek librarian Eratosthenes calculated Earth's circumference in the third century B.C., and from there, scientists can calculate its diameter and radius.

Earth's overall density, which is approximately 5.5 g/cm³, was determined through various calculations and observations. Sir Isaac Newton noted the average density of Earth, and Henry Cavendish's 1797 calculation came close to the currently accepted value. The density increases with depth due to the increasing pressure and temperature within Earth's interior. This increase is also supported by the behavior of rocks encountered in deep mines and drill holes, which differ significantly from surface rocks due to the enormous pressure they experience.

### Question 6

>Density, however, is another matter; it can be found only indirectly by, for example, comparing the gravitational attraction between Earth and its Moon and between metal spheres of known mass. Scientists carried out these calculations and determined an average density for the planet of 5.52 g/cm 3 . But we know that most of Earth’s surface and near-surface rocks have densities of only 2.5 to 3.0 g/cm 3 . Accordingly, the materials that make up Earth’s interior must be much denser than those near the surface, otherwise, the overall density would be less than 5.52 g/cm

**Q:** **Explain this**

**A:** The passage explains that density is a measure of how much mass is contained in a given volume of an object or substance. In the case of Earth, scientists cannot directly measure its density. Instead, they have to indirectly determine it by comparing the gravitational attraction between Earth and its Moon, or by comparing the gravitational attraction between metal spheres of known mass.

Based on these calculations, scientists have determined that Earth has an average density of 5.52 g/cm^3. However, the rocks at Earth's surface and near-surface have densities ranging from 2.5 to 3.0 g/cm^3. This means that the materials in Earth's interior must be much denser than the surface rocks in order to achieve an average density of 5.52 g/cm^3. If the materials in the interior were less dense, the overall density of Earth would be lower.

In simple terms, this means that Earth's core and other internal layers are composed of materials that are heavier and more compact than the rocks found at the surface.

### Question 7

>Seismic Waves and What They Tell Us  about Earth’s Interior
>
>
> How do geologists study Earth’s interior?
>
>
>The behavior and travel times of P- and S-waves provide geologists with information about Earth’s internal structure. Seismic waves travel outward as wave fronts from their source areas, although it is most convenient to depict them as wave rays, which are lines showing the direction of movement of small parts of wave fronts ( Figure 11.3). Any disturbance such as a passing train or construction equipment causes seismic waves, but only those generated by large earthquakes, explosive volcanism, asteroid impacts, and nuclear explosions travel completely through Earth.
>
>
>As we noted in Chapter 10, P- and S-wave velocity is determined by the density and elasticity of the materials they travel through, both of which increase with depth. Wave velocity is slowed by increasing density but increases in materials with greater elasticity. Because elasticity increases with depth faster than density, a general increase in seismic wave velocity takes place as the waves penetrate to greater depths. P-waves travel faster than S-waves under all circumstances, but unlike P-waves, S-waves are not transmitted through liquids because liquids have no shear strength (rigidity); liquids simply flow in response to shear stress.
>
>
>If Earth were a homogeneous body, P- and S-waves would travel in straight paths as shown in  Figure 11.4a. But as a seismic wave travels from one material into another of different density and elasticity, its velocity and direction of travel change. That is, the wave is bent, a phenomenon known as refraction, in much the same way light waves are refracted as they pass from air into more dense water. Because seismic waves pass through materials of differing density and elasticity, they are continuously refracted so that their paths are curved; wave rays travel in a straight line only when their direction of travel is perpendicular to a boundary ( Figure 11.4b, c).
>
>
>In addition to refraction, seismic waves are reflected, much as light is reflected from a mirror. When seismic waves encounter a boundary separating materials of different density or elasticity, some of a wave’s energy is reflected back to the surface ( Figure 11.4c). If we know the wave velocity and the time required for the wave to travel from its source to the boundary and back to the surface, we can calculate the depth of the reflecting boundary. Such information is useful in determining not only Earth’s internal structure but also the depths of sedimentary rocks that may contain petroleum. Seismic reflection is a common tool used in petroleum exploration.

These marked changes in seismic wave velocity indicate a boundary called a discontinuity across which a significant change in earth materials or their properties occurs. Discontinuities are the basis for subdividing Earth’s interior into concentric layers.
>
>
>The contribution of seismology to the study of Earth’s interior cannot be overstated. Beginning in the early 1900s, scientists recognized the utility of seismic wave studies and, between 1906 and 1936, largely worked out Earth’s internal structure.

**Q:** **Explain this**

**A:** Geologists study Earth's interior by analyzing seismic waves. Seismic waves are produced by large earthquakes, explosive volcanism, asteroid impacts, and nuclear explosions. These waves travel outward from their source, and their behavior and travel times provide valuable information about the internal structure of the Earth.

There are two main types of seismic waves: P-waves (primary waves) and S-waves (secondary waves). P-waves travel faster than S-waves under all circumstances. These waves' velocities are determined by the density and elasticity of the materials they travel through, which both increase with depth. Increasing density slows down wave velocity, while increasing elasticity speeds it up. As the waves penetrate deeper into the Earth, their velocities generally increase due to the increasing elasticity with depth.

If the Earth were a homogeneous body, P- and S-waves would travel in straight paths. However, as seismic waves pass from one material into another with different density and elasticity, their velocities and directions of travel change. This bending of the wave is called refraction, much like how light waves are refracted when passing from air into water. Seismic waves continuously undergo refraction as they pass through materials of different properties, causing their paths to curve instead of being straight.

Seismic waves also experience reflection when they encounter a boundary between materials with different density or elasticity. Some of the wave's energy is reflected back to the surface. By measuring the wave velocity and the time it takes for the wave to travel from its source to the reflecting boundary and back to the surface, geologists can calculate the depth of the reflecting boundary. This information is not only useful for understanding Earth's internal structure but also for determining the depths of sedimentary rocks, which can be important for petroleum exploration.

Discontinuities are significant boundaries in Earth's interior where there are marked changes in seismic wave velocity. These changes indicate a significant change in Earth materials or their properties. Discontinuities help geologists subdivide Earth's interior into concentric layers and provide crucial insights into the structure and composition of the planet.

Seismology, the study of seismic waves, has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of Earth's interior. Scientists began using seismic wave studies in the early 1900s and made significant progress in determining Earth's internal structure between 1906 and 1936. The information obtained from seismic waves has been crucial in shaping our knowledge of the Earth's interior.

>The model of Earth’s interior consisting of a core and a mantle is probably accurate, but not very precise. In recent years, geophysicists have developed a technique called seismic tomography that allows them to develop more accurate models of Earth’s interior. In seismic tomography, numerous crossing seismic waves are analyzed much as CAT (computerized axial tomography) scans are analyzed. In CAT scans,  X rays penetrate the body, and a two-dimensional image of its interior is formed. Repeated CAT scans

>In a similar manner, geophysicists use seismic waves to probe Earth’s interior. In seismic tomography, the average velocities of numerous crossing seismic waves are analyzed so that “slow” and “fast” areas of wave travel are detected. Remember that seismic wave velocity depends partly on elasticity; cold rocks have greater elasticity and thus transmit seismic waves faster than hotter rocks.
>
>
>As a result of studies in seismic tomography, a much clearer picture of Earth’s interior is emerging. It has already given us a better understanding of complex convection within the mantle and a clearer picture of the nature of the mantle–core boundary.

**Q:** **Explain this**

**A:** Seismic tomography is a technique used by geophysicists to understand the structure and composition of Earth's interior. It involves analyzing seismic waves that travel through the Earth to create a three-dimensional image of its interior, similar to how CAT scans create images of the human body.

Seismic waves are generated by earthquakes or man-made sources and they travel through different layers of the Earth at varying speeds. By analyzing the average velocities of these waves, scientists can identify areas where the waves travel slower or faster. This provides information about the elasticity of the rocks in those regions.

Using seismic tomography, scientists have been able to develop more accurate models of Earth's interior compared to the previous model of a core and mantle. It has helped them understand the complex convection processes occurring within the mantle, which plays a significant role in plate tectonics and the movement of Earth's crust. Additionally, seismic tomography has provided a clearer understanding of the boundary between the mantle and the core.

Overall, seismic tomography has contributed to a better understanding of Earth's interior and its dynamic processes, leading to advancements in our knowledge of geology and the Earth sciences.

### Question 9

>Continental Crust
>
>
> How does continental crust differ from oceanic crust? Continental crust and oceanic crust form the outermost layer of Earth, but the former has an overall composition similar to granite whereas the latter is made up of gabbro and basalt. Also, continental crust is less dense and much thicker than oceanic crust. It also has rocks as much as 3.96 billion years old, but no oceanic crust older than about 180 million years is known. So, what do we mean that continental crust is similar to granite? Continental crust is made up of igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks of all kinds, but its overall composition is similar to that of granite, and accordingly we refer to continental crust as granitic.
>
>
>The density of continental crust varies depending on rock type, but with the exception of metal-rich rocks, such as iron ore deposits, most of its rocks have densities of 2.5 to  3.0 g/cm 3 , and the continental crust’s overall or average density is about 2.7 g/cm 3 . P-wave velocity in the continental crust is about 6.75 km/sec, but at the base of the crust,  P-wave velocity abruptly increases to about 8 km/sec. Continental crust averages about 35 km thick, but its thickness varies from 20 to 90 km. Beneath mountain ranges such as the Rocky Mountains, the Alps in Europe, and the  Himalayas in Asia, continental crust is much thicker than it is in adjacent areas. In contrast, continental crust is much thinner than the average beneath the Rift Valleys of East Africa and in a large area called the Basin and Range Province in the western United States and northern Mexico. The crust in these areas has been stretched and thinned in what appear to be the initial stages of rifting. Crustal thickening beneath mountain ranges is an important topic we will return to in a later section of this chapter. 

**Q:** **Explain this**

**A:** Continental crust and oceanic crust are two different types of crust that make up the outermost layer of Earth. The main differences between them are in composition, density, thickness, and age [19]. 

Continental crust is composed of various types of rocks, including igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks, but its overall composition is similar to that of granite [19]. This is why continental crust is often referred to as granitic. It is also much less dense and thicker compared to oceanic crust. The density of continental crust varies depending on the type of rock, but most of its rocks have densities ranging from 2.5 to 3.0 g/cm^3, with an overall or average density of about 2.7 g/cm^3 [7a]. The crust itself averages about 35 km in thickness, but this can vary from 20 to 90 km. In certain areas like mountain ranges such as the Rocky Mountains, the Alps, and the Himalayas, the continental crust is much thicker than in other regions. However, in areas like the Rift Valleys of East Africa and the Basin and Range Province, the continental crust is thinner due to stretching and thinning processes related to rifting [7a].

In contrast, oceanic crust is predominantly made up of basalt and gabbro [19]. It is denser and thinner compared to continental crust [7b]. The average density of oceanic crust is about 3.0 g/cm^3, and its thickness ranges from 5 to 10 km [7b]. It is continuously produced at spreading ridges and then consumed at subduction zones. This is why no oceanic crust older than about 180 million years is known, while continental crust can have rocks as old as 3.96 billion years [19]. 

Overall, the key differences between continental and oceanic crust lie in their composition, density, thickness, and age. These variations in crustal characteristics contribute to the different geological features and processes observed on Earth's surface.

### Question 10

>Variations are also found in oceanic crust—that is, Earth’s crust beneath the ocean basins—but they are not as notable as those in continental crust. Direct observations from submersibles and samples taken during deep-sea drilling confirm that the upper part of the oceanic crust is made up of basalt, whereas its lower part is composed of gabbro. Remember that basalt and gabbro contain the same minerals but have different textures (see Figure 4.19). We will consider the oceanic crust in greater detail in Chapter 12. 
>
>
>With an average density of 3.0 g/cm , oceanic crust is denser than continental crust, and it is also much thinner, varying from 5 to 10 km ( Figure 11.1). It is thinnest at spreading ridges where it is continuously produced. Remember that oceanic crust is consumed at subduction zones, thereby accounting for the fact that none of it is more than 180 million years old. P-waves travel through oceanic crust at about  7 km/sec, but just as at the base of the continental crust, their velocity increases when they enter the underlying mantle.

**Q:** **Explain this**

**A:** This passage explains that oceanic crust, which is the Earth's crust beneath the ocean basins, has some variations but they are not as noticeable as those in continental crust. Direct observations and samples indicate that the upper part of the oceanic crust is composed of basalt, while the lower part is made up of gabbro. Basalt and gabbro have the same minerals but different textures.

The passage further states that oceanic crust has an average density of 3.0 g/cm and is denser than continental crust. It is also much thinner, ranging from 5 to 10 km in thickness. The thinnest parts are found at spreading ridges where new crust is continuously formed. It is important to note that oceanic crust is consumed at subduction zones, which explains why none of it is older than 180 million years.

Additionally, the passage mentions that P-waves (a type of seismic wave) travel through oceanic crust at a velocity of about 7 km/sec. However, similar to the base of the continental crust, their velocity increases when they enter the underlying mantle.

Overall, this passage provides an overview of the characteristics and differences of oceanic crust compared to continental crust.

The waves traveling through the deeper layer (the mantle) travel farther to a seismic station, but they do so more rapidly and arrive before those that travel more slowly in the shallower layer.

>The Moho is present everywhere except beneath spreading ridges. However, its depth varies: Beneath continents, it ranges from 20 to 90 km with an average of 35 km; beneath the seafloor, it is only 5 to 10 km deep. 

**Q:** **Explain this**

**A:** The boundary between the crust and mantle is called the Mohorovicˆic´ discontinuity, or simply the Moho [19]. This boundary was discovered by Yugoslavian seismologist Andrija Mohorovicˆic´ in 1909 while studying seismic waves from earthquakes in the Balkan region [8a]. Mohorovicˆic´ noticed that seismic stations a few hundred kilometers away from an earthquake's epicenter recorded two distinct sets of P- and S-waves [8b]. He concluded that there is a sharp boundary or discontinuity at a depth of about 30 km below the surface, which separates rocks with different properties and marks the boundary between the crust and the mantle [8b]. Mohorovicˆic´ named this boundary the Mohorovicˆic´ discontinuity or the Moho [8b]. The Moho is present everywhere except beneath spreading ridges, and its depth varies depending on the location, ranging from 20 to 90 km beneath continents and 5 to 10 km beneath the seafloor [8c].

The waves traveling through the deeper layer (the mantle) travel farther to a seismic station, but they do so more rapidly and arrive before those that travel more slowly in the shallower layer.

>The Moho is present everywhere except beneath spreading ridges. However, its depth varies: Beneath continents, it ranges from 20 to 90 km with an average of 35 km; beneath the seafloor, it is only 5 to 10 km deep. 

**Q:** **Explain this**

**A:** The presence and depth of the Moho, or Mohorovici
 ˆ ic´ discontinuity, can be explained by the different properties of rocks in the Earth's crust and mantle. The Moho is a sharp boundary that separates these two layers, and it was discovered by analyzing the behavior of seismic waves.

When an earthquake occurs, it generates seismic waves that travel through the Earth's interior. P-waves and S-waves are two types of seismic waves that behave differently as they pass through different types of rocks. P-waves, also known as primary waves, are compressional waves that can travel through both solid and liquid materials. S-waves, or secondary waves, are shear waves that can only travel through solid materials.

By measuring the travel times and velocities of P-waves and S-waves at different depths, Mohorovici
 ˆ ic´ noticed a significant change in their velocities at around 30 km below the surface. P-waves were found to travel at a faster rate of 8 km/sec below this boundary, while S-waves traveled at a slower rate of 6.75 km/sec. This suggested the presence of a distinct boundary with different rock properties.

This boundary, now known as the Mohorovici
 ˆ ic´ discontinuity or the Moho, separates the Earth's crust from the underlying mantle. The crust consists of relatively lighter and less dense rocks compared to the mantle. The difference in rock composition and density at the Moho causes a change in the behavior of seismic waves.

The depth of the Moho varies depending on the location. Beneath continents, it ranges from 20 to 90 km with an average of 35 km, while beneath the seafloor, it is much shallower, typically only 5 to 10 km deep. This variation in depth is due to the different geological processes occurring in these regions.

Overall, the presence and depth of the Moho can be attributed to the distinct properties of rocks in the Earth's crust and mantle, which affect the behavior of seismic waves.

### Question 13

>All of Earth’s interior from the base of the crust to the surface of the core at 2900 km is the mantle. It makes up 83% of the volume of the planet, but because it is less dense than the core, it is only 67.8% of Earth’s mass. Remember from the discussion of the crust–mantle boundary that the Moho marks the base of the crust, or the top of the mantle, and that the Moho varies from 5 to 90 km deep. Beginning in 1958, project Mohole was funded to drill through the crust into the mantle, and it initially received considerable support. But in 1966 it was abandoned when funding dried up because of technological problems. As a consequence, the only direct observations of the mantle have been made from submersibles that descended to the walls of seafloor fractures (see Chapter 12).

>
> What is the low-velocity zone in the mantle?
>
>
>Seismic wave velocity in the mantle increases with depth, but several discontinuities exist. Between depths of 100 and 250 km, both P- and S-wave velocities decrease markedly ( Figure 11.7). This 100- to 250-km-deep layer is the lowvelocity zone, which corresponds closely to the asthenosphere, a layer in which the rocks are close to their melting point and are less elastic, accounting for the observed decrease in seismic wave velocity. The asthenosphere is an important zone because it is where most magma is generated, especially under the ocean basins. Furthermore, it lacks strength, flows plastically, and is thought to be the layer over which the plates of the outer, rigid lithosphere move.
>
>
>Even though the low-velocity zone and the asthenosphere closely correspond, they are still distinct. The asthenosphere appears to be present worldwide, but the low-velocity zone is not. In fact, the low-velocity zone appears to be poorly defined or even absent beneath the ancient shields of continents.
>
>
>Other discontinuities are also present at deeper levels within the mantle. But unlike those between the crust and mantle or between the mantle and core, these probably represent structural changes in minerals rather than compositional changes. In other words, the mantle is composed of the same material throughout, but the structural states of minerals such as olivine change with depth. At a depth of 410 km, seismic wave velocity increases slightly as a consequence of changes in mineral structure ( Figure 11.7). Another velocity increase occurs

**Q:** **Explain this**

**A:** The low-velocity zone in the mantle refers to a depth range of 100 to 250 kilometers where the seismic wave velocities decrease significantly. This zone corresponds closely to the asthenosphere, which is a layer in the mantle where rocks are close to their melting point and less elastic. The decrease in seismic wave velocity is attributed to the asthenosphere's proximity to its melting point and its reduced elasticity.

The asthenosphere is important because it is where most magma is generated, especially under the ocean basins. It is also a weak and plastic layer over which the rigid lithospheric plates move. However, although the low-velocity zone and the asthenosphere have a close correspondence, they are still distinct from each other.

The low-velocity zone is not present universally and can be poorly defined or even absent beneath ancient continental shields. This suggests that its occurrence is not consistent worldwide.

Deeper within the mantle, other discontinuities exist. However, unlike the boundaries between the crust and mantle or the mantle and core, these discontinuities likely represent structural changes in minerals rather than compositional changes. This means that the material composition of the mantle remains the same throughout, but the structural states of minerals, such as olivine, change with increasing depth. These structural changes in minerals cause slight increases in seismic wave velocity at specific depths, such as at 410 kilometers.

>t about 660 km, where the minerals break down into metal oxides, such as FeO (iron oxide) and MgO (magnesium oxide), and silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ). These two discontinuities define the top and base of a transition zone separating the upper mantle from the lower mantle ( Figure 11.7). A decrease in seismic wave velocity in a zone extending 200 to 300 km above the core–mantle boundary is recognized as the D layer. Although commonly included within the lower mantle, the D layer might be considerably different in composition. Experiments indicate that silicates in the mantle react with liquid from the outer core, thus forming a vertically and laterally heterogeneous layer. Some geologists think that mantle plumes originate in the D layer.

>
>
>Although the mantle’s density, which varies from 3.3 to  5.7 g/cm 3 , can be inferred rather accurately from seismic waves, its composition is less certain. The igneous rock peridotite is considered the most likely component of the upper mantle. Peridotite contains mostly ferromagnesian silicates (60% olivine and 30% pyroxene) and about 10% feldspars (see Figures 4.17 and 4.18). Peridotite is considered the most likely candidate for three reasons. First, laboratory experiments indicate that it possesses physical properties that account for the mantle’s density and observed rates of seismic wave transmissions. Second, peridotite forms the lower parts of igneous rock sequences thought to be fragments of the oceanic crust and upper mantle, called ophiolites, emplaced on land (see Chapter 12). And third, peridotite is found as inclusions in volcanic rock bodies such as kimberlite pipes that are known to have come from the mantle at depths of 100 to 300 km ( Figure 11.8). The deeper mantle is likely peridotite-like, but richer in magnesium and iron.

**Q:** **Explain this**

**A:** Geologists have concluded that the mantle is likely made up of peridotite based on several pieces of evidence. First, laboratory experiments have shown that peridotite possesses the physical properties needed to explain the mantle's density and the way seismic waves travel through it. This suggests that peridotite is a good candidate for the composition of the upper mantle.

Second, peridotite is found in ophiolites, which are fragments of the oceanic crust and upper mantle that have been emplaced on land. These ophiolites contain peridotite in their lower parts, further supporting the idea that peridotite is a major component of the mantle.

Lastly, peridotite has been found as inclusions in volcanic rock bodies like kimberlite pipes, which have been known to originate from the mantle at depths of 100 to 300 km. This suggests that peridotite-like rocks are present in the deeper mantle as well, possibly with higher concentrations of magnesium and iron.

Taken together, these lines of evidence strongly suggest that peridotite is a key component of the mantle's composition.

### Question 15

>11.5 The Core
>
>
>Once again seismic waves, experiments, meteorites, and Earth’s overall density indicate that Earth’s deep interior must be made up of materials that are much more dense than those at the surface or in the mantle. So although geologists are confident that Earth does have a core, several aspects of this remote region are not understood. Based on the best available information, the core lies about 2900 km below the surface ( Figure 11.1). Its diameter of 6960 km makes it about the same size as Mars, and it constitutes 16.4% of Earth’s volume and nearly one-third of its mass. 
>
>
>Seismic waves have indicated much of what we know about the core, but seismic tomography reveals that the core–mantle boundary is not as smooth as implied in Fig

**Q:** **Explain this**

**A:** Seismic tomography is a technique that uses seismic waves to image and study the Earth's interior. It provides a more detailed and accurate picture of the Earth's core and mantle structure compared to traditional seismic methods.

The statement suggests that seismic tomography has revealed that the core-mantle boundary is not as smooth as previously believed. This means that there are variations or irregularities in the boundary between the Earth's core and its surrounding mantle.

These variations in the smoothness of the core-mantle boundary could be attributed to several factors. One possible explanation is the presence of mantle plumes, which are localized areas of upwelling hot material from the deep mantle. These plumes can cause irregularities or disruptions in the boundary.

Another factor could be the presence of chemical or mineralogical heterogeneities within the mantle. These variations in composition can lead to differences in density and seismic velocities, which in turn can result in a more complex and non-smooth core-mantle boundary.

It is important to note that despite the advancements in seismic tomography, the information about the Earth's core and core-mantle boundary is still limited and the exact nature of these irregularities is not fully understood. However, ongoing research and technological advancements continue to improve our understanding of the Earth's deep interior.

### Question 16

>ure 11.1. In fact, the surface of the core has broad depressions and rises extending several kilometers into the mantle. Of course, the mantle has the same features in reverse, and it now seems that the core’s outer surface is continuously deformed by sinking and rising masses of mantle material. 

**Q:** **Explain this**

**A:** Based on the given information, it seems that the surface of the Earth's core has uneven areas with depressions and rises that extend into the mantle, which is the layer below the core. Similarly, the mantle also has corresponding features in reverse. This suggests that the outer surface of the core undergoes continuous deformation due to the movement of sinking and rising masses of material from the mantle.

To further explain this, it is important to understand the structure of the Earth. The Earth's interior consists of several layers, including the inner core, outer core, mantle, and crust. The core is primarily composed of iron and nickel, while the mantle is made up of solid rock material.

The movement within the mantle is driven by convection currents. These currents occur due to the heat generated from the Earth's core, causing the mantle material to become less dense and rise upwards. As the material reaches the surface of the core, it can cause deformations in the shape of the core's outer surface.

Conversely, as the mantle material cools down and becomes denser, it sinks back towards the core due to gravitational forces. This sinking motion can also lead to further deformations on the core's surface.

Overall, the continuous movement of mantle material generates a dynamic environment that causes the core's outer surface to constantly deform with sinking and rising masses. This process is part of the Earth's natural geophysical activity.

### Question 17

>ry of Earth’s Core
>
>
>In 1906 R. D. Oldham of the Geological Survey of India realized that seismic waves arrived later than expected at seismic stations more than 130 degrees from an earthquake focus. He postulated that Earth has a core that transmits seismic waves more slowly than shallower Earth materials. We now know that P-wave velocity decreases markedly at a depth of 2900 km, which indicates an important discontinuity recognized as the core–mantle boundary ( Figure 11.5).
>
>
> What are the P- and S-wave shadow zones,  and what do they indicate about Earth’s interior?
>
>
>Because of the sudden decrease in P-wave velocity at the core–mantle boundary, P-waves are refracted in the core so that little P-wave energy reaches the surface between 103 and 143 degrees from an earthquake focus ( Figure 11.9b). This P-wave shadow zone, as it is called, was discovered in 1914 by the German seismologist Beno Gutenberg. However, the P-wave shadow zone is a not a perfect shadow zone because some weak P-wave energy is recorded within it. Scientists proposed several hypotheses to account for this observation, but all were rejected by the Danish seismologist Inge Lehmann ( Figure 11.9a), who in 1936 postulated that the core is not entirely liquid as previously thought. She proposed that seismic wave reflection from a solid inner core accounts for the arrival of weak P-wave energy in the P-wave shadow zone ( Figure 11.9c), a proposal that was quickly accepted by seismologists.
>
>
>In 1926 the British physicist Harold Jeffreys realized that S-waves were not simply slowed by the core but were completely blocked by it. So, besides a P-wave shadow zone, a much larger and more complete S-wave shadow zone also exists ( Figure 11.10). At locations greater than 103 degrees from an earthquake focus, no S-waves are recorded, which indicates that S-waves cannot be transmitted through the core. S-waves will not pass through a liquid, so it seems that the outer core must be liquid or behave as a liquid. The inner core, however, is thought to be solid because P-wave velocity increases at the base of the outer core.

**Q:** **Explain this**

**A:** The P- and S-wave shadow zones are areas on Earth's surface where seismic waves are not detected or are significantly weakened. These shadow zones provide important information about the structure and composition of Earth's interior.

The P-wave shadow zone is a region between about 103 and 143 degrees from the epicenter of an earthquake where P-waves are not strongly detected. This is because P-waves experience a sudden decrease in velocity at the core-mantle boundary, causing them to be refracted or bent as they pass through the core. However, some weak P-wave energy is still recorded within the shadow zone. This led to the realization that the core is not completely liquid as previously believed, but rather has a solid inner core.

The S-wave shadow zone is a larger area that extends beyond the P-wave shadow zone. S-waves, which are slower than P-waves and can only travel through solid materials, are completely blocked by the core. As a result, at distances greater than about 103 degrees from the earthquake epicenter, no S-waves are detected. This indicates that the outer core is likely liquid or behaves as a liquid, as S-waves cannot pass through it, while the inner core is solid.

Overall, the existence and characteristics of these shadow zones provide evidence for the layered structure of Earth's interior, with a solid inner core surrounded by a liquid outer core, mantle, and crust. They also help us understand the behavior and properties of seismic waves, which are essential for studying earthquakes and understanding Earth's structure.

**Q:** **Explain this**

**A:** Inge Lehmann's postulation about the Earth's solid inner core is based on the phenomenon observed in seismic waves. Seismic waves are generated by earthquakes and travel through the Earth's interior. 

P-waves, or primary waves, are one type of seismic wave that can travel through both solid and liquid materials. However, when P-waves encounter a boundary between different materials, they can be refracted or reflected. 

The P-wave shadow zone is a region on the opposite side of the Earth from an earthquake where no direct P-wave energy reaches the surface. This shadow zone is caused by the refraction and reflection of P-waves at the Earth's core-mantle boundary. 

Lehmann proposed that the presence of an inner core explains the arrival of weak P-wave energy in the P-wave shadow zone. Reflection of these waves by the solid inner core could explain why less energy reaches the surface in this specific region. 

Therefore, Lehmann's theory suggests that the inner core is solid, likely composed of a dense metallic material such as iron and nickel. The exact density and composition of the inner and outer cores are estimated using a combination of seismic evidence and laboratory experiments, such as the use of diamond-anvil pressure cells. These methods help scientists study the properties of materials at extremely high pressures and temperatures, similar to those found in the Earth’s core.

### Question 1

>samples are studied while subjected to pressures and temperatures similar to those in the core. Furthermore, meteorites, which are thought to represent remnants of the material from which the solar system formed, are used to make estimates of density and composition. For example, the irons— meteorites composed of iron and nickel alloys—may represent the differentiated interiors of large asteroids and approximate the density and composition of Earth’s core. The density of the outer core varies from 9.9 to 12.2 g/cm and that of the inner core ranges from 12.6 to 13.0 g/cm ( Figure 11.1). At Earth’s center, the pressure is equivalent to about 3.5 million times normal atmospheric pressure.
>
>
>The core cannot be composed of minerals common at the surface because, even under the tremendous pressures at great depth, they would still not be dense enough to yield an average density of 5.52 g/cm 3  for Earth. Both the outer and inner cores are thought to be composed largely of iron, but pure iron is too dense to be the sole constituent of the outer core. It must be “diluted” with elements of lesser density. Laboratory experiments and comparisons with iron meteorites indicate that perhaps 12% of the outer core consists of sulfur and possibly some silicon, oxygen, nickel, and potassium ( Figure 11.1).
>
>
>In contrast, pure iron is not dense enough to account for the estimated density of the inner core, so perhaps 10 to 20% of the inner core consists of nickel. These metals form an iron–nickel alloy thought to be sufficiently dense under the pressure at that depth to account for the density of the inner core.
>
>
>Any model of the core’s composition and physical state must explain not only variations in density but also (1) why the outer core is liquid whereas the inner core is solid and (2) how the magnetic field is generated within the core (discussed later in this chapter). When the core formed during early Earth history, it was probably entirely molten and has since cooled so that its interior has crystallized. Indeed, the inner core continues to grow as Earth slowly cools, and liquid of the outer core crystallizes as iron. Recent evidence also indicates that  at present the inner core rotates faster than the outer core, moving about 20 km/yr relative to the outer core.
>
>
>The temperature at the core–mantle boundary is estimated at 2500° to 5000°C, yet the high pressure within the inner core prevents melting. In contrast, the outer core is under less pressure, but more important than the differences in pressure are compositional differences between the inner and outer cores. The sulfur content of the outer core helps depress its melting temperature. An iron–sulfur mixture melts at a lower temperature than does pure iron, or an iron–nickel alloy, so despite the high pressure, the outer core is molten.

**Q:** **Explain this**

**A:** The passage explains that the composition and physical state of the Earth's core are determined through various methods, including studying samples under high pressures and temperatures similar to those in the core, as well as analyzing meteorites that are believed to represent the material from which the solar system formed.

The density and composition of the core are estimated using meteorites, particularly iron meteorites that are composed of iron and nickel alloys. These iron meteorites are thought to resemble the differentiated interiors of large asteroids and provide an approximation of the density and composition of the Earth's core.

The outer core of the Earth is believed to vary in density from 9.9 to 12.2 g/cm3, while the inner core ranges from 12.6 to 13.0 g/cm3. The pressure at the Earth's center is about 3.5 million times normal atmospheric pressure.

Minerals common at the surface cannot make up the core because, even under the tremendous pressures at great depths, they would not be dense enough to account for the Earth's average density. Instead, both the outer and inner cores are thought to be composed mostly of iron, but not pure iron alone.

The outer core is "diluted" with elements of lesser density, such as sulfur, silicon, oxygen, nickel, and potassium. It is estimated that about 12% of the outer core consists of these elements. The inner core, on the other hand, is believed to contain about 10 to 20% nickel. This iron-nickel alloy is sufficiently dense under the pressure at the core's depth to account for the density of the inner core.

Two important factors that need to be explained about the core's composition and physical state are why the outer core is liquid while the inner core is solid, and how the magnetic field is generated within the core. The core likely formed as a molten state during early Earth history and has since cooled, causing its interior to crystallize. The inner core continues to grow as the Earth cools, and the liquid outer core crystallizes as iron. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that the inner core rotates faster than the outer core.

The temperature at the boundary between the core and mantle is estimated to be between 2500°C and 5000°C, but the high pressure within the inner core prevents it from melting. However, the outer core is under less pressure and its composition, particularly the sulfur content, helps depress its melting temperature. Therefore, despite the high pressure, the outer core remains molten.

### Question 2

>How hot is it inside our planet, and where does the heat come from? The answer to the first part of this question depends on depth because Earth’s temperature increases with depth, but not in a linear fashion. The source of heat is twofold: First, some is residual heat from Earth’s origin, and second, much of Earth’s internal heat is generated by radioactive decay. In any case, internal heat is responsible for Earth’s ongoing seismicity, volcanism, moving plates, and mountain building, or, as previously stated, it is one feature that makes Earth such a dynamic planet.

This temperature increase with depth, or geothermal gradient, near the surface is about 25°C/km. In areas of active or recently active volcanism, the geothermal gradient is greater than in adjacent nonvolcanic areas, and temperature rises faster beneath spreading ridges than elsewhere beneath the seafloor ( Figure 11.11).

>Unfortunately, the geothermal gradient is not useful for estimating temperatures at great depth. If we were simply to extrapolate from the surface downward, the temperature at 100 km would be so high that, despite the great pressure, all known rocks would melt. Yet except for pockets of magma, it appears that the mantle is solid rather than liquid because it transmits S-waves. Accordingly, the geothermal gradient must decrease markedly.

>Current estimates of the temperature at the base of the crust are 800° to 1200°C. The latter figure seems to be an upper limit: If it were any higher, melting would be expected. Furthermore, fragments of mantle rock in kimberlite pipes that came from depths of 100 to 300 km appear to have reached equilibrium at these depths and at about 1200°C. At the core–mantle boundary, the temperature is probably between 2500° and 5000°C; the wide range of values indicates the uncertainties of such estimates. If these figures are reasonably accurate, the geothermal gradient in the mantle is only about 1°C/km.
>
>
>Because the core is so remote and its composition uncertain, only very general estimates of its temperature are possible. Based on various experiments, the maximum temperature at the center of the core is estimated to be 6500°C, very close to the estimated temperature for the surface of the Sun!

>Even though rocks are poor conductors of heat, detectable amounts of heat from Earth’s interior escape at the surface by heat flow.

On the continents, temperature measurements are made at various depths in drill holes and mines.
>
>
>More than 70% of the total heat lost by Earth is lost through the seafloor, but heat-flow values for both oceanic basins and continents decrease with increasing age. This result is expected in the ocean basins because high heat-flow values occur at spreading ridges where oceanic crust is continuously formed by igneous activity. Spreading ridges are also the sites of hydrothermal vents, where heat is transported upward by hydrothermal convection. Heat flow through the continental crust is not as well understood, but it too shows lower values for older crust.
>
>
>It should be apparent that if heat is escaping from within Earth, the interior should be cooling unless a mechanism exists to replenish it. Radioactive decay generates heat continuously, but the quantity of radioactive isotopes (except carbon 14) decreases with time as they decay to stable daughter products. Accordingly, during its early history Earth possessed more internal heat and has been cooling continuously since then

**Q:** **Explain this.**

**A:** The Earth's interior is hot due to two main sources of heat. Firstly, there is residual heat from the planet's origin, which means that when the Earth formed, it released a significant amount of heat. Secondly, a large portion of the Earth's internal heat is generated by radioactive decay. Radioactive isotopes, such as uranium, thorium, and potassium 40, decay and emit energetic particles and gamma rays that heat the surrounding rocks. 

The geothermal gradient is a term used to describe the change in temperature with depth in the Earth's crust. Scientists noticed during the 19th century that the temperature in deep mines and drill holes increases as you go deeper. This temperature increase per kilometer of depth is known as the geothermal gradient, which near the surface is about 25°C/km. However, the geothermal gradient is not useful for estimating the temperature of Earth's core because if we were to extrapolate the gradient from the surface to great depths, the temperature would become so high that all known rocks would melt.

Estimating the temperature at the base of the crust, current estimates range from 800°C to 1200°C. Fragments of mantle rock found in kimberlite pipes, which come from depths of 100 to 300 km, have reached equilibrium at around 1200°C. At the core-mantle boundary, the temperature is believed to be between 2500°C and 5000°C, although there is uncertainty in these estimates. The core's temperature is even more difficult to determine due to its remote location and uncertain composition. However, experiments suggest that the maximum temperature at the center of the core is estimated to be around 6500°C, which is close to the estimated temperature of the Sun's surface.

Despite rocks being poor conductors of heat, some heat does escape to the surface. Heat flow is measured using sensitive instruments through probes in seafloor sediments or temperature measurements in drill holes and mines on land. More than 70% of the heat lost by Earth is lost through the seafloor, but heat-flow values decrease with increasing age for both oceanic and continental crust. This is because in oceanic crust, high heat-flow values occur at spreading ridges where new crust is continuously formed, and in continental crust, older crust has lower heat-flow values.

Although the Earth is continuously cooling due to the loss of heat, radioactive decay provides a continuous source of heat generation. However, the quantity of radioactive isotopes decreases with time as they decay into stable daughter products. So, during its early history, the Earth possessed more internal heat and has been cooling since then.

### Question 3

>Gravity

>
>Gravitational attraction would be the same everywhere on the surface if Earth were perfectly spherical, homogeneous throughout, and not rotating. As a consequence of rotation, however, a centrifugal force is generated that partly counteracts the force of gravity ( Figure 11.12b), so an object at the equator weighs slightly less than the same object would at the poles. The force of gravity also varies with distance between the centers of masses, so an object would weigh slightly less above the surface than if it were at sea level ( Figure 11.12a).

>
>Geologists use a sensitive instrument called a gravimeter to measure variations in the force of gravity. A gravimeter is simple in principle; it contains a weight suspended on a spring that responds to variations in gravity ( Figure 11.13). Long ago, geologists realized that anomalous gravity values should exist over buried bodies of ore minerals and salt domes and that geologic structures such as faulted strata could be located by surface gravity surveys ( Figure 11.13). Gravity measurements are higher over an iron ore deposit than over unconsolidated sediment because of the ore’s greater density ( Figure 11.13a). Such departures from the expected force of gravity are gravity anomalies. In other words, the measurement over the body of iron ore indicates an excess of dense material, or simply a mass excess, between the surface and the center of Earth and is considered a positive gravity anomaly. A negative gravity anomaly indicating a mass deficiency exists over low-density sediments because the force of gravity is less than expected ( Figure 11.13b). Large negative gravity anomalies also exist over salt domes ( Figure 11.13c) and at subduction zones, indicating that the crust is not in equilibrium.

**A:** The tourist sites that claim gravity has gone awry are using clever optical illusions to create the illusion of gravity-defying effects. These illusions can be easily duplicated by anyone with an interest in doing so. It is important to note that these illusions are not actual departures from Earth's gravitational attraction but rather tricks designed to create the illusion of defying gravity.

### Question 4

>What are positive and negative gravity anomalies?
>
>
>Geologists use a sensitive instrument called a gravimeter to measure variations in the force of gravity. A gravimeter is simple in principle; it contains a weight suspended on a spring that responds to variations in gravity ( Figure 11.13). Long ago, geologists realized that anomalous gravity values should exist over buried bodies of ore minerals and salt domes and that geologic structures such as faulted strata could be located by surface gravity surveys ( Figure 11.13). Gravity measurements are higher over an iron ore deposit than over unconsolidated sediment because of the ore’s greater density ( Figure 11.13a). Such departures from the expected force of gravity are gravity anomalies. In other words, the measurement over the body of iron ore indicates an excess of dense material, or simply a mass excess, between the surface and the center of Earth and is considered a positive gravity anomaly. A negative gravity anomaly indicating a mass deficiency exists over low-density sediments because the force of gravity is less than expected ( Figure 11.13b). Large negative gravity anomalies also exist over salt domes ( Figure 11.13c) and at subduction zones, indicating that the crust is not in equilibrium.

**Q:** **Explain this.**

**A:** Positive gravity anomalies occur when there is an excess of dense material between the surface and the center of Earth. This can be caused by the presence of ore minerals, salt domes, or other high-density substances. Geologists use positive gravity anomalies to identify the location of these buried bodies.

On the other hand, negative gravity anomalies occur when there is a mass deficiency, resulting in a lower force of gravity than expected. This is typically observed over low-density sediments, salt domes, or at subduction zones where the crust is not in equilibrium.

The tourist sites that claim gravity has gone awry are actually experiencing optical illusions. These illusions create the perception that gravity is acting differently in these areas. However, in reality, it is due to clever tricks and illusions that manipulate how our brains perceive gravity and visual cues. These illusions can be recreated by anyone with the interest and knowledge of how they work.

>More than 150 years ago, British surveyors in India detected a discrepancy of 177 m when they compared the results of two measurements between points 600 km apart. Even though this discrepancy was small, only about 0.03%, it was an unacceptably large error. The surveyors realized that the gravitational attraction of the nearby Himalaya Mountains probably deflected the plumb line (a cord with a suspended weight) of their surveying instruments from the vertical, thus accounting for the error. Calculations revealed, however, that if the Himalayas were simply thicker crust piled on denser material, the error should have been greater than that observed ( Figure 11.14a).
>
>
>In 1865 George Airy proposed that, in addition to projecting high above sea level, the Himalayas—and other mountains as well—project far below the surface and thus have a low-density root ( Figure 11.14b). In effect, he was saying that mountains float on denser rock at depth. Their excess mass above sea level is compensated for by a mass deficiency at depth, which would account for the observed deflection of the plumb line during the British survey  ( Figure 11.14).
>
>
>Another explanation was proposed by J. H. Pratt, who thought that the Himalayas were high because they were composed of rocks of lower density that those in adjacent regions. Although Airy was correct with respect to the Himalayas, and mountains in general, Pratt was correct in that there are indeed places where the crust’s elevation is related to its density. For example, (1) continental crust is thicker and less dense than oceanic crust and thus stands high, and (2) the mid-oceanic ridges stand higher than adjacent areas because the crust there is hot and less dense than cooler oceanic crust elsewhere.

>Gravity and seismic studies have revealed that mountains do indeed have a low-density “root” projecting deep into the mantle. If it were not for this low-density root, a gravity survey across a mountainous area would reveal a huge positive gravity anomaly. The fact that no such anomaly exists indicates that a mass excess is not present, so some of the dense mantle at depth must be displaced by lighter crustal rocks, as shown in  Figure 11.14b.

>Both Airy and Pratt agreed that Earth’s crust is in floating equilibrium with the more dense mantle below, and

**Q:** **Explain this**

**A:** The principle of isostasy explains how it is possible for Earth's crust to "float" in the mantle. The crust and mantle are both solid, but they have different densities. The crust is less dense than the mantle.

When a mountain or a continent is formed, it has a lower density compared to the surrounding mantle. This causes it to "float" or be buoyant in the denser mantle. Just like a block of wood floats in water because it is less dense than water, the crust floats in the mantle because it is less dense than the mantle.

The concept of floating equilibrium is important here. It means that the crust and mantle are balanced in such a way that the forces of gravity on the crust are equal to the upward force exerted by the buoyancy of the mantle. This equilibrium prevents the crust from sinking into the mantle or rising above it.

George Airy proposed the idea of low-density roots, suggesting that mountains and other elevated landforms have deeper extensions of low-density rock within the mantle. These low-density roots compensate for the excess mass of the crust above sea level. J. H. Pratt also contributed to the understanding of isostasy by suggesting that variations in crustal density can influence the elevation of landforms.

Gravity and seismic studies have confirmed the existence of these low-density roots in mountains. If the crust did not have these roots, gravity anomalies would be detected, indicating a mass excess. But the absence of such anomalies suggests that the crust displaces some of the denser mantle at depth.

In conclusion, Earth's crust is able to "float" in the mantle due to differences in density. The principle of isostasy explains how the crust and mantle achieve a balanced state of floating equilibrium, with low-density roots supporting the elevation of mountains and other landforms.

### Question 6

>Earth’s crust is similar to the iceberg, or a ship, in that it sinks into the mantle to its equilibrium level. Where the crust is thickest, as beneath mountain ranges, it sinks farther down into the mantle but also rises higher above the equilibrium surface ( Figure 11.14b). Continental crust, being thicker and less dense than oceanic crust, stands higher than the ocean basins. Earth’s crust responds isostatically to widespread erosion and sediment deposition ( Figure 11.16). It also responds to loading when vast glaciers form and depress the crust into the mantle to maintain equilibrium ( Figure 11.17). In Greenland and Antarctica, the crust has been depressed below sea level by the weight of glacial ice.

Scandinavia, which was covered by an ice sheet until about 10,000 years ago, is still rebounding at a rate of up to 1 m per century ( Figure 11.18). Coastal cities in Scandinavia have been uplifted rapidly enough that docks constructed several centuries ago are now far from shore. Isostatic rebound has also occurred in eastern Canada, where the land has risen as much as 100 m during the last 6000 years.

>If the principle of isostasy is correct, it implies that the mantle behaves like a liquid. In preceding discussions, though, we said that the mantle must be solid because it transmits S-waves, which will not move through a liquid. How can this apparent paradox be resolved? When considered in terms of the short time necessary for S-waves to pass through it, the mantle is indeed solid. But when subjected to stress over long periods, it yields by flowage and at these timescales is a viscous liquid. Silly Putty, a familiar substance that has the properties of a solid or a liquid depending on how rapidly deforming forces are applied, will flow under its own weight if given enough time, but shatters as a brittle solid if struck a sharp blow.

**Q:** **now their proposal is known as the principle of isostasy. This phenomenon is easy to understand by analogy to a ship or an iceberg ( Figure 11.15). Ice is slightly less dense than water, and thus it floats. According to Archimedes’s principle of buoyancy, an iceberg sinks in water until it displaces a volume of water whose weight is equal to that of the ice. When the iceberg has sunk to an equilibrium position, only about 10% of its volume is above water level. If some of the ice above water level should melt, the iceberg rises in order to maintain the same proportion of ice above and below water ( Figure 11.15b)..**

**A:** The Earth's crust behaves similarly to an iceberg or a ship, sinking into the mantle until it reaches its equilibrium level. In areas where the crust is thicker, such as beneath mountain ranges, it sinks even farther into the mantle but also rises higher above the equilibrium surface. Continental crust, being thicker and less dense than oceanic crust, stands higher than the ocean basins. 

The Earth's crust responds to various factors, such as erosion and sediment deposition, by adjusting its position isostatically. If there is widespread erosion or sediment deposition, the crust will adjust by either sinking or rising to maintain equilibrium. Additionally, when glaciers form, they can depress the crust into the mantle to maintain equilibrium. In places like Greenland and Antarctica, the weight of glacial ice has caused the crust to be depressed below sea level.

When the weight of the crust is reduced or removed, it responds by rising until equilibrium is restored. This phenomenon is known as isostatic rebound. It occurs in areas that were deeply eroded and were previously covered by glaciers. For example, Scandinavia, which was covered by an ice sheet until about 10,000 years ago, is still rebounding at a rate of up to 1 meter per century. This rebound has caused coastal cities in Scandinavia to experience rapid uplift, changing the positions of docks constructed centuries ago.

The concept of isostasy suggests that the mantle behaves like a liquid, which seems contradictory to the fact that it transmits S-waves, which only travel through solids. However, this paradox can be resolved by considering the timescales involved. In the short time it takes for S-waves to pass through the mantle, it behaves as a solid. But over long periods of time, when subjected to stress, the mantle can flow and behave as a viscous liquid. This behavior is similar to substances like Silly Putty, which can act as both a solid and a liquid depending on the rate of deformation.

Overall, the principle of isostasy explains how the crust of the Earth responds to changes in weight and distribution of materials, either by sinking or rising, in order to maintain equilibrium. This principle helps us understand various geological phenomena, such as the effects of erosion, sediment deposition, and glaciation on the Earth's crust.

### Question 7

>11.9 Earth’s Magnetic Field
>
>
>In Chapter 2 you learned that Earth’s magnetic field provided evidence for plate tectonic theory, but what is magnetism and what is a magnetic field? Magnetism is a physical phenomenon resulting from the spin of electrons in some solids, particularly those of iron, and moving electricity. A magnetic field is an area in which magnetic substances, such as iron, are affected by lines of magnetic force emanating from a magnet ( Figure 11.19). Note that Earth’s magnetic field (see Figure 2.7) resembles on a large scale the magnetic field around the magnet in Figure 11.19.

>Ancient people noticed the strange power of lodestone, the mineral magnetite, to attract and hold metal objects such as tools (see Figure 3.19b). Thus an attractive force exists between a magnet and some objects, so how does it differ from gravity, which is also an attractive force? Actually, several centuries ago no distinction was made between these phenomena, but they are in fact different. Gravity depends on the masses of objects and the distance between their centers of mass, whereas magnetism results from moving electricity and the spin of electrons in some solids. Furthermore, anything with mass is affected by gravity, but only some substances are magnetic.

>Experts on magnetism do not fully understand all aspects of Earth’s magnetic field, but most agree that electrical currents resulting from convection in the liquid outer core generate it.

The model most widely accepted now is that thermal and compositional convection within the liquid outer core coupled with Earth’s rotation produce com

**Q:** **Explain this.**

**A:** The Earth's magnetic field is generated by electrical currents that are produced by convection in the liquid outer core. Convection is the process of heat transfer through the movement of material, in this case, the liquid outer core. As the core heats up, it becomes less dense and rises, while the cooler, denser material sinks. This movement of material creates electrical currents. 

The convection is driven by a combination of thermal and compositional differences within the core, as well as the rotation of the Earth. This convection process continuously generates the magnetic field. If this process were to stop, the magnetic field would decay over time and eventually disappear. Scientists believe that the Earth's magnetic field has been generated in this way for billions of years.

>In Chapter 2 we mentioned magnetic anomalies, deviations from the average strength of Earth’s magnetic field, when we discussed seafloor spreading (see Figure 2.11). Anomalies may be either positive or negative, and anomalies occur on both regional and local scales. Regional anomalies are most likely related to complexities of convection in the outer core, but local anomalies result from vertical and lateral variations of rock types within the crust.

>
>In the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada, huge iron ore deposits add their magnetism to Earth’s magnetic field, resulting in a positive gravity anomaly ( Figure 11.20a). Areas underlain by thick basalt lava flows also show positive anomalies, but an adjacent area of sedimentary rocks shows a negative anomaly  ( Figure 11.20b). Geologists use an instrument called a magnetometer to detect slight variations in the strength of the magnetic field. In fact, magnetometers have been used for decades to locate deeply buried iron ore deposits and to find buried structures, such as salt domes that show negative magnetic anomalies ( Figure 11.20c).

>● Scientists think that thermal and compositional convection in the outer core generates Earth’s magnetic field. 

**Q:** **Explain this.**

**A:** Thermal and compositional convection in the outer core is believed to generate Earth's magnetic field. The outer core of the Earth is made up of molten iron and nickel, and it experiences intense heat due to the high temperatures at the Earth's core. 

The heat from the inner core causes the molten outer core to be in a constant state of motion. This motion creates convection currents, where warmer material rises and cooler material sinks. These convection currents are driven by the temperature difference between the inner and outer core.

Additionally, there are composition differences within the outer core. The outer core is not a uniform mixture of elements, and there are variations in the concentrations of iron and nickel. These compositional variations also contribute to the convection currents.

As the molten material in the outer core moves, it generates electrical currents. These electrical currents, in turn, produce a magnetic field through a process called the dynamo effect. The movement of the electrically conductive material in the outer core, coupled with the Earth's rotation, creates a self-exciting dynamo. This self-exciting dynamo generates and sustains the Earth's magnetic field.

The magnetic field generated by this process extends out from the core into space and is responsible for many phenomena we observe on Earth, such as compass directions, auroras, and the protection of our atmosphere from solar winds.
