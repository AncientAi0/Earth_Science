### Question 1

>samples are studied while subjected to pressures and temperatures similar to those in the core. Furthermore, meteorites, which are thought to represent remnants of the material from which the solar system formed, are used to make estimates of density and composition. For example, the irons— meteorites composed of iron and nickel alloys—may represent the differentiated interiors of large asteroids and approximate the density and composition of Earth’s core. The density of the outer core varies from 9.9 to 12.2 g/cm and that of the inner core ranges from 12.6 to 13.0 g/cm ( Figure 11.1). At Earth’s center, the pressure is equivalent to about 3.5 million times normal atmospheric pressure.
>
>
>The core cannot be composed of minerals common at the surface because, even under the tremendous pressures at great depth, they would still not be dense enough to yield an average density of 5.52 g/cm 3  for Earth. Both the outer and inner cores are thought to be composed largely of iron, but pure iron is too dense to be the sole constituent of the outer core. It must be “diluted” with elements of lesser density. Laboratory experiments and comparisons with iron meteorites indicate that perhaps 12% of the outer core consists of sulfur and possibly some silicon, oxygen, nickel, and potassium ( Figure 11.1).
>
>
>In contrast, pure iron is not dense enough to account for the estimated density of the inner core, so perhaps 10 to 20% of the inner core consists of nickel. These metals form an iron–nickel alloy thought to be sufficiently dense under the pressure at that depth to account for the density of the inner core.
>
>
>Any model of the core’s composition and physical state must explain not only variations in density but also (1) why the outer core is liquid whereas the inner core is solid and (2) how the magnetic field is generated within the core (discussed later in this chapter). When the core formed during early Earth history, it was probably entirely molten and has since cooled so that its interior has crystallized. Indeed, the inner core continues to grow as Earth slowly cools, and liquid of the outer core crystallizes as iron. Recent evidence also indicates that  at present the inner core rotates faster than the outer core, moving about 20 km/yr relative to the outer core.
>
>
>The temperature at the core–mantle boundary is estimated at 2500° to 5000°C, yet the high pressure within the inner core prevents melting. In contrast, the outer core is under less pressure, but more important than the differences in pressure are compositional differences between the inner and outer cores. The sulfur content of the outer core helps depress its melting temperature. An iron–sulfur mixture melts at a lower temperature than does pure iron, or an iron–nickel alloy, so despite the high pressure, the outer core is molten.

**Q:** **Explain this**

**A:** The passage explains that the composition and physical state of the Earth's core are determined through various methods, including studying samples under high pressures and temperatures similar to those in the core, as well as analyzing meteorites that are believed to represent the material from which the solar system formed.

The density and composition of the core are estimated using meteorites, particularly iron meteorites that are composed of iron and nickel alloys. These iron meteorites are thought to resemble the differentiated interiors of large asteroids and provide an approximation of the density and composition of the Earth's core.

The outer core of the Earth is believed to vary in density from 9.9 to 12.2 g/cm3, while the inner core ranges from 12.6 to 13.0 g/cm3. The pressure at the Earth's center is about 3.5 million times normal atmospheric pressure.

Minerals common at the surface cannot make up the core because, even under the tremendous pressures at great depths, they would not be dense enough to account for the Earth's average density. Instead, both the outer and inner cores are thought to be composed mostly of iron, but not pure iron alone.

The outer core is "diluted" with elements of lesser density, such as sulfur, silicon, oxygen, nickel, and potassium. It is estimated that about 12% of the outer core consists of these elements. The inner core, on the other hand, is believed to contain about 10 to 20% nickel. This iron-nickel alloy is sufficiently dense under the pressure at the core's depth to account for the density of the inner core.

Two important factors that need to be explained about the core's composition and physical state are why the outer core is liquid while the inner core is solid, and how the magnetic field is generated within the core. The core likely formed as a molten state during early Earth history and has since cooled, causing its interior to crystallize. The inner core continues to grow as the Earth cools, and the liquid outer core crystallizes as iron. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that the inner core rotates faster than the outer core.

The temperature at the boundary between the core and mantle is estimated to be between 2500°C and 5000°C, but the high pressure within the inner core prevents it from melting. However, the outer core is under less pressure and its composition, particularly the sulfur content, helps depress its melting temperature. Therefore, despite the high pressure, the outer core remains molten.

### Question 2

>How hot is it inside our planet, and where does the heat come from? The answer to the first part of this question depends on depth because Earth’s temperature increases with depth, but not in a linear fashion. The source of heat is twofold: First, some is residual heat from Earth’s origin, and second, much of Earth’s internal heat is generated by radioactive decay. In any case, internal heat is responsible for Earth’s ongoing seismicity, volcanism, moving plates, and mountain building, or, as previously stated, it is one feature that makes Earth such a dynamic planet.

>During the 19th century, scientists realized that the temperature in deep mines increases with depth. More recently, the same trend has been observed in deep drill holes. This temperature increase with depth, or geothermal gradient, near the surface is about 25°C/km. In areas of active or recently active volcanism, the geothermal gradient is greater than in adjacent nonvolcanic areas, and temperature rises faster beneath spreading ridges than elsewhere beneath the seafloor ( Figure 11.11).

>
>
>Unfortunately, the geothermal gradient is not useful for estimating temperatures at great depth. If we were simply to extrapolate from the surface downward, the temperature at 100 km would be so high that, despite the great pressure, all known rocks would melt. Yet except for pockets of magma, it appears that the mantle is solid rather than liquid because it transmits S-waves. Accordingly, the geothermal gradient must decrease markedly.
>
>
>Current estimates of the temperature at the base of the crust are 800° to 1200°C. The latter figure seems to be an upper limit: If it were any higher, melting would be expected. Furthermore, fragments of mantle rock in kimberlite pipes that came from depths of 100 to 300 km appear to have reached equilibrium at these depths and at about 1200°C. At the core–mantle boundary, the temperature is probably between 2500° and 5000°C; the wide range of values indicates the uncertainties of such estimates. If these figures are reasonably accurate, the geothermal gradient in the mantle is only about 1°C/km.
>
>
>Because the core is so remote and its composition uncertain, only very general estimates of its temperature are possible. Based on various experiments, the maximum temperature at the center of the core is estimated to be 6500°C, very close to the estimated temperature for the surface of the Sun!
>
>
>Even though rocks are poor conductors of heat, detectable amounts of heat from Earth’s interior escape at the surface by heat flow. The amount of heat lost is small and is detected only by sensitive instruments. Heavy, cylindrical probes are dropped into soft seafloor sediments, and temperatures are measured at various depths along the cylinder. On the continents, temperature measurements are made at various depths in drill holes and mines.
>
>
>More than 70% of the total heat lost by Earth is lost through the seafloor, but heat-flow values for both oceanic basins and continents decrease with increasing age. This result is expected in the ocean basins because high heat-flow values occur at spreading ridges where oceanic crust is continuously formed by igneous activity. Spreading ridges are also the sites of hydrothermal vents, where heat is transported upward by hydrothermal convection. Heat flow through the continental crust is not as well understood, but it too shows lower values for older crust.
>
>
>It should be apparent that if heat is escaping from within Earth, the interior should be cooling unless a mechanism exists to replenish it. Radioactive decay generates heat continuously, but the quantity of radioactive isotopes (except carbon 14) decreases with time as they decay to stable daughter products. Accordingly, during its early history Earth possessed more internal heat and has been cooling continuously since then

**Q:** **Explain this.**

**A:** The Earth's interior is hot due to two main sources of heat. Firstly, there is residual heat from the planet's origin, which means that when the Earth formed, it released a significant amount of heat. Secondly, a large portion of the Earth's internal heat is generated by radioactive decay. Radioactive isotopes, such as uranium, thorium, and potassium 40, decay and emit energetic particles and gamma rays that heat the surrounding rocks. 

The geothermal gradient is a term used to describe the change in temperature with depth in the Earth's crust. Scientists noticed during the 19th century that the temperature in deep mines and drill holes increases as you go deeper. This temperature increase per kilometer of depth is known as the geothermal gradient, which near the surface is about 25°C/km. However, the geothermal gradient is not useful for estimating the temperature of Earth's core because if we were to extrapolate the gradient from the surface to great depths, the temperature would become so high that all known rocks would melt.

Estimating the temperature at the base of the crust, current estimates range from 800°C to 1200°C. Fragments of mantle rock found in kimberlite pipes, which come from depths of 100 to 300 km, have reached equilibrium at around 1200°C. At the core-mantle boundary, the temperature is believed to be between 2500°C and 5000°C, although there is uncertainty in these estimates. The core's temperature is even more difficult to determine due to its remote location and uncertain composition. However, experiments suggest that the maximum temperature at the center of the core is estimated to be around 6500°C, which is close to the estimated temperature of the Sun's surface.

Despite rocks being poor conductors of heat, some heat does escape to the surface. Heat flow is measured using sensitive instruments through probes in seafloor sediments or temperature measurements in drill holes and mines on land. More than 70% of the heat lost by Earth is lost through the seafloor, but heat-flow values decrease with increasing age for both oceanic and continental crust. This is because in oceanic crust, high heat-flow values occur at spreading ridges where new crust is continuously formed, and in continental crust, older crust has lower heat-flow values.

Although the Earth is continuously cooling due to the loss of heat, radioactive decay provides a continuous source of heat generation. However, the quantity of radioactive isotopes decreases with time as they decay into stable daughter products. So, during its early history, the Earth possessed more internal heat and has been cooling since then.

### Question 3

>Gravitational attraction would be the same everywhere on the surface if Earth were perfectly spherical, homogeneous throughout, and not rotating. As a consequence of rotation, however, a centrifugal force is generated that partly counteracts the force of gravity ( Figure 11.12b), so an object at the equator weighs slightly less than the same object would at the poles. The force of gravity also varies with distance between the centers of masses, so an object would weigh slightly less above the surface than if it were at sea level ( Figure 11.12a).

A gravimeter is simple in principle; it contains a weight suspended on a spring that responds to variations in gravity ( Figure 11.13). Long ago, geologists realized that anomalous gravity values should exist over buried bodies of ore minerals and salt domes and that geologic structures such as faulted strata could be located by surface gravity surveys ( Figure 11.13). Gravity measurements are higher over an iron ore deposit than over unconsolidated sediment because of the ore’s greater density ( Figure 11.13a). Such departures from the expected force of gravity are gravity anomalies. In other words, the measurement over the body of iron ore indicates an excess of dense material, or simply a mass excess, between the surface and the center of Earth and is considered a positive gravity anomaly. A negative gravity anomaly indicating a mass deficiency exists over low-density sediments because the force of gravity is less than expected ( Figure 11.13b). Large negative gravity anomalies also exist over salt domes ( Figure 11.13c) and at subduction zones, indicating that the crust is not in equilibrium.

All are actually clever optical illusions that can be duplicated by anyone with the interest in doing so.

**Q:** **Explain this.**

**A:** The tourist sites that claim gravity has gone awry are using clever optical illusions to create the illusion of gravity-defying effects. These illusions can be easily duplicated by anyone with an interest in doing so. It is important to note that these illusions are not actual departures from Earth's gravitational attraction but rather tricks designed to create the illusion of defying gravity.

**Q:** **Explain this.**

**A:** Positive gravity anomalies occur when there is an excess of dense material between the surface and the center of Earth. This can be caused by the presence of ore minerals, salt domes, or other high-density substances. Geologists use positive gravity anomalies to identify the location of these buried bodies.

On the other hand, negative gravity anomalies occur when there is a mass deficiency, resulting in a lower force of gravity than expected. This is typically observed over low-density sediments, salt domes, or at subduction zones where the crust is not in equilibrium.

The tourist sites that claim gravity has gone awry are actually experiencing optical illusions. These illusions create the perception that gravity is acting differently in these areas. However, in reality, it is due to clever tricks and illusions that manipulate how our brains perceive gravity and visual cues. These illusions can be recreated by anyone with the interest and knowledge of how they work.

>We previously said that Earth’s crust and mantle are solids except for pockets of magma, so how is it possible for a solid (continental crust) to float in another solid (the mantle)?

Actually, they do float, in a manner of speaking, in the denser mantle below, but a complete answer requires much more discussion.
>
>
>More than 150 years ago, British surveyors in India detected a discrepancy of 177 m when they compared the results of two measurements between points 600 km apart. Even though this discrepancy was small, only about 0.03%, it was an unacceptably large error. The surveyors realized that the gravitational attraction of the nearby Himalaya Mountains probably deflected the plumb line (a cord with a suspended weight) of their surveying instruments from the vertical, thus accounting for the error. Calculations revealed, however, that if the Himalayas were simply thicker crust piled on denser material, the error should have been greater than that observed ( Figure 11.14a).
>
>
>In 1865 George Airy proposed that, in addition to projecting high above sea level, the Himalayas—and other mountains as well—project far below the surface and thus have a low-density root ( Figure 11.14b). In effect, he was saying that mountains float on denser rock at depth. Their excess mass above sea level is compensated for by a mass deficiency at depth, which would account for the observed deflection of the plumb line during the British survey  ( Figure 11.14).
>
>
>Another explanation was proposed by J. H. Pratt, who thought that the Himalayas were high because they were composed of rocks of lower density that those in adjacent regions. Although Airy was correct with respect to the Himalayas, and mountains in general, Pratt was correct in that there are indeed places where the crust’s elevation is related to its density. For example, (1) continental crust is thicker and less dense than oceanic crust and thus stands high, and (2) the mid-oceanic ridges stand higher than adjacent areas because the crust there is hot and less dense than cooler oceanic crust elsewhere.
>
>
>Gravity and seismic studies have revealed that mountains do indeed have a low-density “root” projecting deep into the mantle. If it were not for this low-density root, a gravity survey across a mountainous area would reveal a huge positive gravity anomaly. The fact that no such anomaly exists indicates that a mass excess is not present, so some of the dense mantle at depth must be displaced by lighter crustal rocks, as shown in  Figure 11.14b.
>

>Both Airy and Pratt agreed that Earth’s crust is in floating equilibrium with the more dense mantle below, and

**Q:** **Explain this**

**A:** The principle of isostasy explains how it is possible for Earth's crust to "float" in the mantle. The crust and mantle are both solid, but they have different densities. The crust is less dense than the mantle.

When a mountain or a continent is formed, it has a lower density compared to the surrounding mantle. This causes it to "float" or be buoyant in the denser mantle. Just like a block of wood floats in water because it is less dense than water, the crust floats in the mantle because it is less dense than the mantle.

The concept of floating equilibrium is important here. It means that the crust and mantle are balanced in such a way that the forces of gravity on the crust are equal to the upward force exerted by the buoyancy of the mantle. This equilibrium prevents the crust from sinking into the mantle or rising above it.

George Airy proposed the idea of low-density roots, suggesting that mountains and other elevated landforms have deeper extensions of low-density rock within the mantle. These low-density roots compensate for the excess mass of the crust above sea level. J. H. Pratt also contributed to the understanding of isostasy by suggesting that variations in crustal density can influence the elevation of landforms.

Gravity and seismic studies have confirmed the existence of these low-density roots in mountains. If the crust did not have these roots, gravity anomalies would be detected, indicating a mass excess. But the absence of such anomalies suggests that the crust displaces some of the denser mantle at depth.

In conclusion, Earth's crust is able to "float" in the mantle due to differences in density. The principle of isostasy explains how the crust and mantle achieve a balanced state of floating equilibrium, with low-density roots supporting the elevation of mountains and other landforms.

### Question 6

>Earth’s crust is similar to the iceberg, or a ship, in that it sinks into the mantle to its equilibrium level. Where the crust is thickest, as beneath mountain ranges, it sinks farther down into the mantle but also rises higher above the equilibrium surface ( Figure 11.14b). Continental crust, being thicker and less dense than oceanic crust, stands higher than the ocean basins. Earth’s crust responds isostatically to widespread erosion and sediment deposition ( Figure 11.16). It also responds to loading when vast glaciers form and depress the crust into the mantle to maintain equilibrium ( Figure 11.17). In Greenland and Antarctica, the crust has been depressed below sea level by the weight of glacial ice.

Scandinavia, which was covered by an ice sheet until about 10,000 years ago, is still rebounding at a rate of up to 1 m per century ( Figure 11.18). Coastal cities in Scandinavia have been uplifted rapidly enough that docks constructed several centuries ago are now far from shore. Isostatic rebound has also occurred in eastern Canada, where the land has risen as much as 100 m during the last 6000 years.

>If the principle of isostasy is correct, it implies that the mantle behaves like a liquid. In preceding discussions, though, we said that the mantle must be solid because it transmits S-waves, which will not move through a liquid. How can this apparent paradox be resolved? When considered in terms of the short time necessary for S-waves to pass through it, the mantle is indeed solid. But when subjected to stress over long periods, it yields by flowage and at these timescales is a viscous liquid. Silly Putty, a familiar substance that has the properties of a solid or a liquid depending on how rapidly deforming forces are applied, will flow under its own weight if given enough time, but shatters as a brittle solid if struck a sharp blow.

**Q:** **now their proposal is known as the principle of isostasy. This phenomenon is easy to understand by analogy to a ship or an iceberg ( Figure 11.15). Ice is slightly less dense than water, and thus it floats. According to Archimedes’s principle of buoyancy, an iceberg sinks in water until it displaces a volume of water whose weight is equal to that of the ice. When the iceberg has sunk to an equilibrium position, only about 10% of its volume is above water level. If some of the ice above water level should melt, the iceberg rises in order to maintain the same proportion of ice above and below water ( Figure 11.15b)..**

**A:** The Earth's crust behaves similarly to an iceberg or a ship, sinking into the mantle until it reaches its equilibrium level. In areas where the crust is thicker, such as beneath mountain ranges, it sinks even farther into the mantle but also rises higher above the equilibrium surface. Continental crust, being thicker and less dense than oceanic crust, stands higher than the ocean basins. 

The Earth's crust responds to various factors, such as erosion and sediment deposition, by adjusting its position isostatically. If there is widespread erosion or sediment deposition, the crust will adjust by either sinking or rising to maintain equilibrium. Additionally, when glaciers form, they can depress the crust into the mantle to maintain equilibrium. In places like Greenland and Antarctica, the weight of glacial ice has caused the crust to be depressed below sea level.

When the weight of the crust is reduced or removed, it responds by rising until equilibrium is restored. This phenomenon is known as isostatic rebound. It occurs in areas that were deeply eroded and were previously covered by glaciers. For example, Scandinavia, which was covered by an ice sheet until about 10,000 years ago, is still rebounding at a rate of up to 1 meter per century. This rebound has caused coastal cities in Scandinavia to experience rapid uplift, changing the positions of docks constructed centuries ago.

The concept of isostasy suggests that the mantle behaves like a liquid, which seems contradictory to the fact that it transmits S-waves, which only travel through solids. However, this paradox can be resolved by considering the timescales involved. In the short time it takes for S-waves to pass through the mantle, it behaves as a solid. But over long periods of time, when subjected to stress, the mantle can flow and behave as a viscous liquid. This behavior is similar to substances like Silly Putty, which can act as both a solid and a liquid depending on the rate of deformation.

Overall, the principle of isostasy explains how the crust of the Earth responds to changes in weight and distribution of materials, either by sinking or rising, in order to maintain equilibrium. This principle helps us understand various geological phenomena, such as the effects of erosion, sediment deposition, and glaciation on the Earth's crust.

### Question 7

>11.9 Earth’s Magnetic Field

>
>In Chapter 2 you learned that Earth’s magnetic field provided evidence for plate tectonic theory, but what is magnetism and what is a magnetic field? Magnetism is a physical phenomenon resulting from the spin of electrons in some solids, particularly those of iron, and moving electricity. A magnetic field is an area in which magnetic substances, such as iron, are affected by lines of magnetic force emanating from a magnet ( Figure 11.19). Note that Earth’s magnetic field (see Figure 2.7) resembles on a large scale the magnetic field around the magnet in Figure 11.19.

>Ancient people noticed the strange power of lodestone, the mineral magnetite, to attract and hold metal objects such as tools (see Figure 3.19b). Thus an attractive force exists between a magnet and some objects, so how does it differ from gravity, which is also an attractive force? Actually, several centuries ago no distinction was made between these phenomena, but they are in fact different. Gravity depends on the masses of objects and the distance between their centers of mass, whereas magnetism results from moving electricity and the spin of electrons in some solids. Furthermore, anything with mass is affected by gravity, but only some substances are magnetic.

>Experts on magnetism do not fully understand all aspects of Earth’s magnetic field, but most agree that electrical currents resulting from convection in the liquid outer core generate it.

The model most widely accepted now is that thermal and compositional convection within the liquid outer core coupled with Earth’s rotation produce com

**Q:** **Explain this.**

**A:** The Earth's magnetic field is generated by electrical currents that are produced by convection in the liquid outer core. Convection is the process of heat transfer through the movement of material, in this case, the liquid outer core. As the core heats up, it becomes less dense and rises, while the cooler, denser material sinks. This movement of material creates electrical currents. 

The convection is driven by a combination of thermal and compositional differences within the core, as well as the rotation of the Earth. This convection process continuously generates the magnetic field. If this process were to stop, the magnetic field would decay over time and eventually disappear. Scientists believe that the Earth's magnetic field has been generated in this way for billions of years.

>In Chapter 2 we mentioned magnetic anomalies, deviations from the average strength of Earth’s magnetic field, when we discussed seafloor spreading (see Figure 2.11). Anomalies may be either positive or negative, and anomalies occur on both regional and local scales. Regional anomalies are most likely related to complexities of convection in the outer core, but local anomalies result from vertical and lateral variations of rock types within the crust.

>In the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada, huge iron ore deposits add their magnetism to Earth’s magnetic field, resulting in a positive gravity anomaly ( Figure 11.20a). Areas underlain by thick basalt lava flows also show positive anomalies, but an adjacent area of sedimentary rocks shows a negative anomaly  ( Figure 11.20b). Geologists use an instrument called a magnetometer to detect slight variations in the strength of the magnetic field. In fact, magnetometers have been used for decades to locate deeply buried iron ore deposits and to find buried structures, such as salt domes that show negative magnetic anomalies ( Figure 11.20c).

>● Scientists think that thermal and compositional convection in the outer core generates Earth’s magnetic field. 

**Q:** **Explain this.**

**A:** Thermal and compositional convection in the outer core is believed to generate Earth's magnetic field. The outer core of the Earth is made up of molten iron and nickel, and it experiences intense heat due to the high temperatures at the Earth's core. 

The heat from the inner core causes the molten outer core to be in a constant state of motion. This motion creates convection currents, where warmer material rises and cooler material sinks. These convection currents are driven by the temperature difference between the inner and outer core.

Additionally, there are composition differences within the outer core. The outer core is not a uniform mixture of elements, and there are variations in the concentrations of iron and nickel. These compositional variations also contribute to the convection currents.

As the molten material in the outer core moves, it generates electrical currents. These electrical currents, in turn, produce a magnetic field through a process called the dynamo effect. The movement of the electrically conductive material in the outer core, coupled with the Earth's rotation, creates a self-exciting dynamo. This self-exciting dynamo generates and sustains the Earth's magnetic field.

The magnetic field generated by this process extends out from the core into space and is responsible for many phenomena we observe on Earth, such as compass directions, auroras, and the protection of our atmosphere from solar winds.
